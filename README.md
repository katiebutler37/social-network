## Description
- The motivation for creating this repository was to create a social network api where users are able to share their thought, react to the thoughts of others and maintain a list of friends.
- This backend NoSQL MongoDB API may be connected to a front-end project to create a full-stack social media application.
- While creating this API, I was able to learn more about the NoSQL, Mongoose and MongoDB, and continue to get comfortable with the express.js npm CRUD routes and server set up.
